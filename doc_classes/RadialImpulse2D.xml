	<brief_description>
		Applies an impulse into all 2D physical bodies within radius of this node.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Upon calling [method apply_impulse], an impulse will be applied into all 2D physical bodies that are in radius from this node's position.
		Internally this uses a circle [CollisionShape2D] to detect which bodies are in radius.

		<method name="apply_impulse">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Request this node to apply an impulse into all 2D physical bodies that are within [member radius] and in the relevant collision layers. Please note that the impulse will be applied only in the physics iteration, meaning that it [i]might[/i] be slightly delayed in comparison to the actual call to this function. If a task is required to be done when the impulse is actually applied, then perform that in an event handler, dealing with [signal impulse_applied].
				The magnitude of the impulse is determined by the [member force] and [member falloff] properties.

			<description>
				When [method apply_impulse] is called, the impulse is not immediately applied, but rather setup to be done in the physics iteration of this node. This signal is emitted as soon as the impulse occurs.

	<constants>
		<constant name="CONSTANT" value="0" enum="ImpulseFalloff">
			When [member falloff] is set to this value, then the impulse magnitude will be identical in every single affected physical body, regardless of distance from this node.

		<constant name="LINEAR" value="1" enum="ImpulseFalloff">
			When [member falloff] is set to this value, then the impulse magnitude linearly decays the further it is from the center of this node, until it becomes [i]0[/i] at the exact [member radius] distance.
